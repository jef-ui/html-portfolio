        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
        <p>
            I’m an experienced IT Specialist with over 12 years of professional experience in web system development, deployment, and maintenance. Currently working at the Office of Civil Defense MIMAROPA, I specialize in building and managing efficient digital solutions that streamline operations and enhance data-driven decision-making. Throughout my career, I’ve developed and deployed multiple in-house systems — including the Communication Logging Management System (CLMS) and Inventory Management System (IMS) — improving workflow automation and database performance. I’m also skilled in UI/UX design, graphic and video production, and GIS mapping using tools like QGIS to support situational awareness during disaster operations. My technical expertise extends across Windows Server and Linux (Ubuntu) environments, network configuration, system security, and version control (Git/GitHub). Beyond development, I actively contribute to training sessions, EOC operations, and technical support for emergency response teams, ensuring continuous system reliability even under pressure. I’m currently pursuing a Master in Information Technology at Philippine Christian University, further strengthening my foundation in advanced IT systems and web technologies. Driven by curiosity and commitment to public service, I strive to create technology solutions that are both impactful and user-centered, bridging innovation and real-world needs.
